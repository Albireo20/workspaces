First Git experience
==========

Hello fellow github users,

my name is Stephan and I do an apprenticeship to become a software developer here in Germany, 
but until now to my own shame I never used git. 

I want to change that and try to get a better knowledge on different programming languages. 
So I will start commiting some of my test code, for now they won't be fancy stuff but hopefully in the future that will change.

So if you come across my repository and find something that you think could be done better in a different way please feel free to show me that way.

Regards
Stephan
